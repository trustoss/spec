Open Source Software you can trust. A set of standards for Open Source Software projects that establish and maintain trust in your community. A Code for San Francisco Infrastructure Initiative.

### Purpose
Open source projects are build on trust. Trust between maintainers and contributors. Trust between end users and maintainers. Trust between project members and community partners. As trust is built around a project, adoption and community grow, leading to greater impact. TrustOSS is a proposed project governance standard built around the goal of building and maintaining trust in your projects.

### Status

This project is currently in **Discovery** or **Ideation** phase. We're building out a simple set of standard files for pre-v1, however that spec is subject to change. 

### Pre-v1

The pre-v1 spec for essential files and scoffolding tool is based on research done at National Day of Civic Hacking, 2016, at Code for San Francisco. The whiteboad screenshot is listed below for documentation purposes.
